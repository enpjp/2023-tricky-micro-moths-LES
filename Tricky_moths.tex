\begin{frame}{What Is A Micro-moth?}
\protect\hypertarget{what-is-a-micro-moth}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is a tricky question to answer as there no taxonomic difference,
  as in butterflies and moths. Even that is a bit blurred.
\item
  So far as I can tell, the larger moths are those that were described
  in South vols 1 and 2 ``The Moths of the British Isles'', and the rest
  are the micro-moths.
\item
  In the olden days when we used a light trap there we so many large
  moths that we were never tempted by the micros that were trampled by
  the \emph{Noctua pronuba} (Large Yellow Underwing) which came in their
  hundreds.
\item
  Micros were collected by rearing out series collected off food plants
  and mines.
\item
  The first (and current) editions of ``The Field Guide To The Smaller
  Lepidoptera'' contain no illustrations of adult moths at all.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Wot! No Illustrations?}
\protect\hypertarget{wot-no-illustrations}{}
Don't worry, I will use them later in this presentation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Without illustrations the emphasis for identification rested on
  descriptions of the larval behaviour and food plants.
\item
  Adults were set and pinned as a ``series''.
\item
  Just to emphasise, you had to be really proficient with your plant
  identification too.
\item
  My old copy of Clapham, Tutin, and Warburgh ``The Excursion Flora Of
  The British Isle'' was also without images.
\item
  To those of you only used to modern illustrated field guides this must
  sound very strange, but the point I make is that a good identification
  is based on a collection of evidence, not a match to an image.

  Light traps catch fewer moths these days, so the micro-moths are more
  obvious.
\item
  The publication of the excellent illustrated `Field Guide to the
  Micro-Moths of Great Britain and Ireland' has helped popularise this
  group further.
\item
  BUT, the temptation for beginners is to `pattern match' from a field
  guide.
\item
  The availability of `Apps' reinforces this approach.
